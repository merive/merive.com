                    Hello, I'm Max aka merive_, I'm programmer.
                    <br>I write in Python, Java, HTML/CSS.
                    <br>I've been programming for over a year now.
                    <br>I donâ€™t remember how it all began, but I came to programming in the summer of 2019, then I
                    began
                    to study Python...

                <h2><b>Python</b></h2>
                <p>
                    For several months, more precisely 3, I studied Python and its libraries.
                    <br>Today I know more than 15 libraries and am able to work with them.
                    <br>I love this language since it was my beginning, it is like the first teacher...

                <h2><b>HTML/CSS</b></h2>
                <p>
                    My acquaintance with HTML began during the study of Python and I did not like it, it was not
                    clear
                    to me.
                    <br>Later, when I began to delve into it, I realized how easy and useful it is.
                    <br>There were no problems with the CSS and I quickly studied it...

                <h2><b>Java</b></h2>
                <p>
                    I have long wanted to learn Java.
                    <br>I started learning this language at the beginning of 2020.
                    <br>Now I am making applications with GUI and really love this language.
                    <br>Soon I will study Android programming...

                <h2><b>Now</b></h2>
                <p>
                    Now programming is part of my life, just a year ago I was just thinking of becoming a
                    programmer,
                    and now I am one.
                    <br>I am glad that I made my future so.
                    <br>Every day I do something, study, learn.
                    <br>Programming has opened a new world for me...
