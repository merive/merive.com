			<b>Start</b>
			<p>
				Hello, I'm Max aka merive_, I'm programmer.
				<br>I write in Python, Java, HTML/CSS.
				<br>I've been programming for over a year now.
				<br>I donâ€™t remember how it all began, but I came to programming in the summer of 2019, then I began to study Python...
			</p>
			<br><br><br><br><br><br>
			<b>Python</b>
			<p>
				For several months, more precisely 3, I studied Python and its libraries.
				<br>Today I know more than 15 libraries and am able to work with them.
				<br>I love this language since it was my beginning, it is like the first teacher...
			</p>
			<br><br><br><br><br><br>
			<b>HTML/CSS</b>
			<p>
				My acquaintance with HTML began during the study of Python and I did not like it, it was not clear to me.
				<br>Later, when I began to delve into it, I realized how easy and useful it is.
				<br>There were no problems with the CSS and I quickly studied it...
			</p>
			<br><br><br><br><br><br>
			<b>Java</b>
			<p>
				I have long wanted to learn Java.
				<br>I started learning this language at the beginning of 2020.
				<br>Now I am making applications with GUI and really love this language.
				<br>Soon I will study Android programming ...
			</p>
			<br><br><br><br><br><br>
			<b>Now</b>
			<p>
				Now programming is part of my life, just a year ago I was just thinking of becoming a programmer, and now I am one.
				<br>I am glad that I made my future so.
				<br>Every day I do something, study, learn.
				<br>Programming has opened a new world for me ...
