    <h2><b>Start</b></h2>
    <p style="line-height: 1.8">
        Hello, I'm Max aka merive_, I'm programmer.

        <br>I write in Python, Java, HTML/CSS.

        <br>Started learning C, Assembler, Bash.

        <br>I've been programming for over a year now.

        <br>I donâ€™t remember how it all began, 
        <br>&emsp;but I came to programming in the summer of 2019,
        <br>&emsp;then I began to study Python...
    </p>
    <h2><b>Python</b></h2>
    <p style="line-height: 1.8">
        I know python and its libraries (namely more than 15)
        <br>&emsp;for over a year.

        <br>I loved this language from the very beginning.
    </p>
    <h2><b>HTML/CSS</b></h2>
    <p style="line-height: 1.8">
        My acquaintance with HTML began during the study of Python &
        <br>&emsp;I did not like it, it was not clear to me.

        <br>Later, when I began to delve into it,<br>&emsp;
        I realized how easy and useful it is.

        <br>There were no problems with the CSS & I quickly studied it...
    </p>
    <h2><b>Java</b></h2>
    <p style="line-height: 1.8">
        I have wanted to learn Java for a long time.

        <br>I started learning this language at the beginning of 2020.

        <br>I am currently making GUI apps and Android apps.

        <br>I really like to write in this language.
    </p>
    <h2><b>Linux & Bash</b></h2>
    <p style="line-height: 1.8">
        I recently became familiar with Linux.

        <br>I have a very positive experience with this OS,
        <br>&emsp;primarily because of bash.

        <br>I really enjoy working in it.
    </p>
    <h2><b>C/Assembler</b></h2>
    <p style="line-height: 1.8">
        I became interested in exploits,
        <br>&emsp;and that's how I got to know C & Assambler.

        <br>C is easy for me as I am familiar with similar languages.

        <br>But we are not very familiar with Assembler yet.
    </p>
    <h2><b>Now</b></h2>
    <p style="line-height: 1.8">
        Now programming is part of my life,
        <br>&emsp;just a year ago I was just thinking of becoming a programmer,
        <br>&emsp;and now I am one.
        
        <br>I like what i do.

        <br>Every day I do something, study.

        <br>Programming has opened a new world for me...
    </p>
