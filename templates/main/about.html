    <h2><b>Start</b></h2>
    <p>
        Hello, I'm Max aka merive_, I'm programmer.

        I write in Python, Java, HTML/CSS.

        Started learning C, Assembler, Bash.

        I've been programming for over a year now.

        I donâ€™t remember how it all began,
        but I came to programming in the summer of 2019,
        then I began to study Python...
    </p>
    <h2><b>Python</b></h2>
    <p>
        I know python and its libraries (namely more than 15)
        for over a year.

        I loved this language from the very beginning.
    </p>
    <h2><b>HTML/CSS</b></h2>
    <p>
        My acquaintance with HTML began during the study of Python &
        I did not like it, it was not clear to me.

        Later, when I began to delve into it,
        I realized how easy and useful it is.

        There were no problems with the CSS & I quickly studied it...
    </p>
    <h2><b>Java</b></h2>
    <p>
        I have wanted to learn Java for a long time.

        I started learning this language at the beginning of 2020.

        I am currently making GUI apps and Android apps.

        I really like to write in this language.
    </p>
    <h2><b>Linux & Bash</b></h2>
    <p>
        I recently became familiar with Linux.

        I have a very positive experience with this OS,
        primarily because of bash.

        I really enjoy working in it.
    </p>
    <h2><b>C/Assembler</b></h2>
    <p>
        I became interested in exploits,
        and that's how I got to know C & Assambler.

        C is easy for me as I am familiar with similar languages.

        But we are not very familiar with Assembler yet.
    </p>
    <h2><b>Now</b></h2>
    <p>
        Now programming is part of my life,
        just a year ago I was just thinking of becoming a programmer,
        and now I am one.

        I like what i do.

        Every day I do something, study.

        Programming has opened a new world for me...
